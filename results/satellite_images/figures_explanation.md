The figures in this repository all show a histogram with 6 columns, each of them representing a different type of land usage for classification. The orange column indicates the correct category for the corresponding satellite images, which are shown above the histograms. The y-axis shows the probability which the neural network assigns to each category. If it does not assign a high probability to any single one of the categories, it will return the category -1. This means that the model restrains from picking any category (which is penalized less harshly than a confident misclassification).
