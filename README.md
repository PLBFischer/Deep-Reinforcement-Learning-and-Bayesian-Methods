# Deep Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian Methods

I took the course "Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence" by Prof. Andreas Krause at ETH Zurich, which involved 4 graded coding assignments in Python. Since publishing solutions to the assignments is explicitely not allowed, I will only grant access to a private repository upon request by recruiters. The tasks were as follows:

1. Use Gaussian process regression to predict urban air pollution.

2. Set up and train a Bayesian Neural Network to classify satellite images according to land usage.

3. Improve the bioavailability of a drug through constrained Gaussian optimization (Expected Improvement with Constraints).

4. Balance an inverted pendulum by implementing the soft actor-critic algorithm.
